This is a music player app with feature such as pause, play, next, and prev buttons for easy use.

The app also includes a seek bar allowing the user to skip through or reverse certain sections of a
song the app will also display the album art associated with song if no album art is found a placeholder image will take its place.

Further more you can use the recycler view to select any song that has been detected in the android audio file directory.

Caution when adding songs to the android emulator as when you drag and drop a song onto the emulator you first need to play
the song in the android file download section for it to correctly move to the audio files directory (I am not sure why it is like this).
